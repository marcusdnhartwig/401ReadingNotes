## Upgrade your Technical Skills w/ Deliberate Practice

- If you build software you program every day. That doesn't mean you get better at programming every day.

- Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better. It exposes you to new opportunities, expands your knowledge into multiple fields and ultimately allows you to do more things with computers.

- **It doesn't happen by accident.**

- To upgrade your hard technical skills however, you'll need to apply *deliberate practice.*

- "Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety."

- Deliberate practice can be summarized as:
    - Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance.

- The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:
    - Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
    - Repeated often
    - Feedback on results in continuously available
    - It's highly demanding mentally
    - It's difficult
    - It requires good goals

- We're all self-taught in this business. The only person who understands your skillset well enough to teach you is you. What challenges can you set yourself that meet these criteria?

- Whatever challenges you settle on, they need to be repeated often. Much of the benefit of learning a new technique or skill is the ability to apply it in novel situations.

- For technical problems, we're lucky in that we get constant feedback on the correctness of our solutions. The code either runs and produces the desired output or it doesn't. It's much harder however to get good quality feedback on more subjective measures of our code: how easy it is to understand, how well-organised it is or how secure it is.

*Here is some fun challenges*

## Carol Dweck - Video

- The power of "YET"

- Not yet = your on a learning curve.. *not* failure.

- **My inteligence isn't up for judgement!**

- There is freedom in yet, there is tyranny in now.

- Having a fixed mindeset will cause one to run from error. Having a growth mindset will permit one to engage in the error.

- Don't praise the tallent, praise the process.

- Effort and difficulty != dumb and unsurmountable

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit - Video

- The best preformers != great IQ

- In education the best thing we know how to measure is IQ, but what if great preformance couldn't be measured this way. 

- Who is successful and WHY?
    - GRIT => **Passion and perserverance over a sustained period of time.**
    - GRIT => **Having stamina**
    - GRIT => **Living life as a marathon**
    - GRIT => **Long term engagement towards the goal**

- *Talant doesn't make you gritty*

- Having a growth mindset cultivates GRIT.

- Failure isn't a perminant condition.

- Have grit in getting GRITTIER!

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Succes - Video

- It's easier now to make a good living, it's also just as easy to have a crisis due to our careers.

- YAY... Snobes. One who takes a single part of a person to paint an entire picture that person.

- Job snobery... "What do you do?"

- It's not the materialism that we aspire for, but rather the status it brings.

- ENVY is linked to the spirit of equality.

- When you can't relate to someone you can't envy them.. The closer you are to a person in age, background and such the more apt you are in danger of envy.

- The problem of envy is that the world has now become a school of comparison.

- Success via merrit = by virtue failure via merrit... And then people will stay in their laines.
    - A 1500 pessant was an unfortunate, one who was born without fortune, and ther would be no means to adiquately achieve fortune in any real way. Today, "anyone" can achive frotune.

- There are more suicides in developed parts of the world than in undeveloped... Could envy be a masive problem?
    - People own their success BUT also their failure.

- It is a sin to judge a man by their post, only God can place men in proper judgement - Saint Augustine

- We fear the judgment and ridicule of other from our failure... Not our *actual* failure.

- We are worshipers of **SELF**

- You can't be successful at everything.

- With success in life we have to be honest about where we are *'failing'* at.

- Success should be **self described**.

## Emotional Intelligence - Assessment

Self-Awareness = 14
Self-Management = 17
Social Awareness = 19
Relationship Management = 16

* A note about this assessment, I have a very hard time rating myself as a 5 in anything.
* I would say that my self-awareness is actually higher than my self-management... You can take that arguement up with my wife. lol.

## My Biases - Assessment

My score was 100/120 = you have high self awareness, curiosity, and courage. But this is not a
topic you ever master. You should continue your journey in this area by examining where you still have room
for improvement based on 1 or 2 of the 8 areas of unconscious bias where you scored the lowest.

1. Which area is your strongest?
    - Bias and Identity & Connect to Mitigate Bias = 14

2. Which area could you grow?
    - Bias and the Brain & Four Ways to Act = 11

3. Which of the areas will you cocus on in the coming weeks and beyond?
    - Try to get input from friends, colleagues, or leaders before making critical decisions.
