# Anger

Why I am angry.. You have abused your possition of power over our lives from the beginning.

You use your dissagrements as reasons to accuse others of being disrespectful.

You've have propelled your emotions onto Denise because you've had no one to vent to.

You've emotionally abused Denise and expressed 'sorry' as a means of saying whatever you want to say.

You've said 'Do you want me to kill myself' more times than I care to number.

Your emotions are the only ones that get to be valid and your anger is the only anger that gets to be justified.

You refuse to treat Denise as an adult and you refuse to actually support Denise in the ways that matter.

You've gaslite Denise and are manipulating her with your threats when you get backed into a corner.

You are a fake person in your desire to give.

Your love is conditional. And apperances are more important to you than goodness.

Your forgiveness is conditional.

You project your emotions as a means of being manipulitve. And you recognize it and justify it.

You've used my past as an infantryman as a means to cause pain in Denise.

You've projected phisical aggression where I've never expressed such.

You've threatened to throw things and hit me.

You nitpick every thing that Denise does.

You feign victimization where you've actually been the abuser.

You behave as your 'povission' is a means to act the way that you do.

You act as your 'possition' gives you license to say whatever you want without being stood up to.

You act as if my protection of Denise is rudeness to you.

You are a narcissist who keeps the story about themselves and looks to keep yourself from taking responsibility of their actions.

The only person alowed to feel anything is you. The only person alowed to throw a tantrum is you and you give yourself license because 'i am sick'.

You give us the silent treatment and blame us for your behaviour.

You consistantly express that it's not your role to help us with our home (simple things) because you are not "the help".
