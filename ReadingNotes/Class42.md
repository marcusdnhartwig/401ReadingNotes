## Ethics in the Workplace

  **[The Code I'm Still Ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)**

**¡¿WHAT?!**
If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not outright unethical.

As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.

The more software continues to take over every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever-present in our code.

  * **Personal Note:** I think that it is vital to work w/in companies that hold the same values that you do. If you just throw yourself into a job that doesn't hold the same moral ground that you do, then it is likly that you will be forced to compromise your moral integity to get the job done, OR be forced to quit. Personally, I want to only commit myself to a company that I can align with. Both w/in their mission, vision, and values.

## Ethics in Technology

**[Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)**

We are in the middle of a technological upheaval that will transform the way society is organized. We must make the right decisions now

    “Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another.” —Immanuel Kant, “What is Enlightenment?” (1784)

**In 2016 we produced as much data as in the entire history of humankind through 2015.**

Everything will become intelligent; soon we will not only have smart phones, but also smart homes, smart factories and smart cities. Should we also expect these developments to result in smart nations and a smarter planet?

The field of artificial intelligence is, indeed, making breathtaking advances. In particular, it is contributing to the automation of data analysis. Artificial intelligence is no longer programmed line by line, but is now capable of learning, thereby continuously developing itself. 

Experts are starting to ring alarm bells. Technology visionaries, such as Elon Musk from Tesla Motors, Bill Gates from Microsoft and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, are warning that super-intelligence is a serious danger for humanity, possibly even more dangerous than nuclear weapons.

One thing is clear: the way in which we organize the economy and society will change fundamentally. We are experiencing the largest transformation since the end of the Second World War; after the automation of production and the creation of self-driving cars the automation of society is next. 

In the 1940s, the American mathematician Norbert Wiener (1894–1964) invented cybernetics. According to him, the behavior of systems could be controlled by the means of suitable feedbacks. 

Today, Singapore is seen as a perfect example of a data-controlled society. What started as a program to protect its citizens from terrorism has ended up influencing economic and immigration policy, the property market and school curricula. 

Collective intelligence requires a high degree of diversity. This is, however, being reduced by today's personalized information systems, which reinforce trends.

We are at the historic moment, where we have to decide on the right path—a path that allows us all to benefit from the digital revolution. Therefore, we urge to adhere to the following fundamental principles:

  1. to increasingly decentralize the function of information systems;

  2. to support informational self-determination and participation;

  3. to improve transparency in order to achieve greater trust;

  4. to reduce the distortion and pollution of information;

  5. to enable user-controlled information filters;

  6. to support social and economic diversity;

  7. to improve interoperability and collaborative opportunities;

  8. to create digital assistants and coordination tools;

  9. to support collective intelligence, and

  10. to promote responsible behavior of citizens in the digital world through digital literacy and enlightenment.

* **Personal Note:** There is some stuff in this article that is pretty wild. I will say that the information in this article is a bit dated. Coming from 2017. I think that this article could use an update, especially with a post 2020, Covid world. I would like to think that the influence of tech and AI will be the future of humanity and the benifit of it. I am eager to get into this industry where I can personally see the humanity behind our technology.
