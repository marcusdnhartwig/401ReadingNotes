# CLASS 43 Readings: Open-Source Software Contribution

*All notes taken from reading material*

## [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

Friendly Open Source projects should reserve specific issues for newbies.

Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you’re a Code Newbie or maybe you’ve been coding for a while but haven’t found a project you felt comfortable contributing to.

First timer contributions are normally very small and easy (One recent first-timers-only issue was literally three lines of simple changes! And the changes were described in great detail and tested by the project maintainer). But this makes it easier for the contributor to get the hang of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself. Remember, this isn’t as much about getting your project features implemented quickly as it is about helping first timers.

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

For many outside of the IT world, the concept of contributing to open-source software seems like a remarkable psychological phenomenon, as many of the contributors do it by their own free will and are quite often unpaid for it. The thought of contributing to something that requires a good amount of time without getting a dime for their work can be hard to fully understand.

However, for developers especially, contributing to open-source software provides many valuable advantages and opens doors to a number of highly lucrative and rewarding opportunities, and there are not too many other industries that can boast the massive number of global contributions like the open-source community can.

  1. Improve Coding Skills

  2. Gain Early Experience

  3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition

  4. Greater Job Prospects

  5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.

  * Build effective and efficient ways to quantifiably promote, preserve, and protect biodiversity

  * Reduce global food insecurity through, as examples, improvements to distribution or sustainable farming practices

  * Build equitable access to sustainability solutions, education, and job opportunities
